Here is a **single-endpoint async/await + fetch problem**
👉 focused on **fetch → state → render → interactivity**

Perfect for React or Vanilla JS.

---

# 🧩 Problem: Post Viewer App

## 🎯 Objective

Fetch posts from JSONPlaceholder and display them on a webpage using **async/await**.

---

# 📡 API to Use

```text
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

---

# 📝 Task

Create an async function:

```js
async function loadPosts()
```

---

# ⚙️ Requirements

## 1️⃣ Fetch Data

* Use `fetch`
* Use `async/await`
* Fetch all posts from the API

---

## 2️⃣ Display on Webpage

For each post show:

* Post ID
* Title
* Body

Render them as **cards** or **list items**

---

## 3️⃣ Limit the Data

Show **only first 10 posts**

---

## 4️⃣ Add Interactivity

Add a button:

```text
Show Only Even ID Posts
```

When clicked:

* Filter posts where `id % 2 === 0`
* Re-render the UI

---

## 5️⃣ Loading State

Before fetch completes:

```text
Loading posts...
```

---

## 6️⃣ Error Handling

If API fails:

```text
Failed to load posts
```

Use `try/catch`.

---

# 🧱 Expected Function Flow

```text
Page loads  
→ show "Loading..."  
→ fetch posts  
→ display first 10  
→ user clicks filter button  
→ show only even ID posts
```

---

# ⭐ Bonus (Optional)

Students can extend:

🔹 Add search by title
🔹 Add sort by ID (asc/desc)
🔹 Add refresh button
🔹 Cache fetched data (no second API call)
